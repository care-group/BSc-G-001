proposal: Now we are in the bedroom. $openhab=lightb 
The bedroom looks very comfortable, isn't it? You can totally relax youself on this soft bed. Ah, the light outside is so bright, I will turn down the blind and dim the light for you to ensure you can have a good sleep.^break

Do you feel bored? How about chatting with me? $onStopped=$1
